# Marlowe / Hydra Proof of Concept

## Introduction

In the repository we are exploring the deployment of [Marlowe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe) contracts on [Hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc) heads.

As Hydra allows to run [Plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus) smart contracts, we will reuse the [Marlowe/Cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano) code basis that contains the Marlowe validator for Plutus and deploy it to a `hydra-node`. 

## Scope

We plan to extend `marlowe-cli` for setting up the Marlowe contracts and interacting with the `hydra-node`.

## Delivery

The delivery is a demo of how to run a specific Marlowe contract on Hydra.
